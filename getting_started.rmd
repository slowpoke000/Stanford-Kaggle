Getting Started with Kaggle Competition
========================================================

After downloading the .csv files, we load the data as usual.

```{r}
# Change this to your data directory
#data.dir <- "/Users/Ricky/Dropbox/2015_aut/stats202/"
#setwd(data.dir)
# Read in each data files into a data frame
training.target <- read.csv("training_target.csv")
training.features <- read.csv("training_features.csv")
validation.features <- read.csv("validation_features.csv")
validation.target <- read.csv("validation_target.csv")
leaderboard.features<- read.csv("leaderboard_features.csv")
```

Let's take a look at the format of **training.target** data:

```{r}
head(training.target)
```

We also load the **leaderboard_predictions-example.csv** file to see the output format. 

```{r}
leaderboard.predictions <- read.csv("leaderboard_predictions-example.csv") 
head(leaderboard.predictions)
```
The format matches with the **training.target**. 

Here, for each leaderboard subject, let's predict the target by the mean of the training target.

```{r}
training_target_mean <- mean(training.target$ALSFRS_slope)
print(training_target_mean)
leaderboard.predictions$ALSFRS_slope <- training_target_mean
```

We use **write.csv** function to write a CSV file in the contest format with the leaderboard subject predictions. 

```{r}
write.csv(leaderboard.predictions, file = "leaderboard_predictions-training_mean.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```
